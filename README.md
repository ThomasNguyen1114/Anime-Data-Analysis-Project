# Anime Analysis Project

This project analyzes anime ratings and membership trends using Python. It explores how the rating of an anime correlates with the number of members following it. The analysis involves data cleaning, statistical calculations, and visualizations to gain insights into the data.

## **Project Features**
- **Data Cleaning:** Processed the dataset by filling missing values in `anime.csv`.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculated key statistics including mean, median, mode, and standard deviation of anime ratings.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Used Pearson's correlation coefficient to examine the relationship between ratings and membership count.
- **Data Visualization:** Created scatterplots to visualize the relationship between anime ratings and member counts.

## **Technologies Used**
- Python (with libraries: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Visual Studio Code (for coding and running the script)
  
## **How to Run the Project**
1. **Clone the repository**:
   git clone https://github.com/ThomasNguyen1114/Data-Analysis-of-Anime-Ratings
2. Install required libraries:
   pip install pandas numpy scipy seaborn matplotlib
3. Run the analysis script:
